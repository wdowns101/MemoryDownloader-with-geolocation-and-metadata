# Snapchat Memory Downloader

This Python script helps you download all your Snapchat memories from a JSON export.  

---

## How It Works

1. Export your Snapchat memories as a JSON file from Snapchat.
2. Provide the location of that JSON file in the script (`JSON_FILE` variable).
3. Choose the output directory where you want all your memories to be saved (`OUTPUT_DIR` variable).  

> **Tip for macOS users:** If you want to save directly to an external drive, use the path format `/Volumes/Name_of_Drive`.

4. Run the script:

```bash
python3 download_snapchat.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Internet connection (to download media files)
- urllib (comes with Python standard library)
- Access to the JSON export from Snapchat
